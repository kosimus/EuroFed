## Section 1: Unity and Association
Europe is a federation of voluntarily associated States, united in pursuit of common goals while respecting the diversity of its member nations.

Sovereignty is shared between the people of Europe and the individual member States, exercised in the forms established by this Constitution.

## Explanation
This alternative proposal acknowledges the diverse nature of Europe and the importance of voluntary association. It emphasizes unity while recognizing the sovereignty of both the European people and individual member States. The inclusion of a right to withdraw addresses concerns about national sovereignty and provides a legal framework for potential exit, aiming to balance the goals of European integration with respect for national identities and the democratic will of individual member States.
