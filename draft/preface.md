It signifies the collective will of the European people to form a federation that upholds justice, cooperation, and prosperity. This statement reflects the shared values and aspirations of the diverse nations within Europe, emphasizing their commitment to work together for the common good.

### Justice
The commitment to justice ensures that the rights and freedoms of all citizens are protected. It aims to create a fair and equitable society where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

### Cooperation
Cooperation is at the heart of the federation, promoting collaboration among member states. By working together, European nations can address common challenges, share resources, and achieve greater success collectively than they could individually.
